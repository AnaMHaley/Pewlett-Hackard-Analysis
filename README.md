# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview

I have been assigned to determine the number of retiring employees of the Pewlett Hackard company by title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  This is to assist the manager for the upcoming “silver tsunami”, as many current employees are reaching retirement age.


# Results


During my analysis, I initially created a physical ERD using QuickDBD to help create a database of employees.

My findings are as follows:


•	90,398 employees will retire soon

•	The majority of retiring employees have senior positions

•	1,549 employees are eligible for mentorship program.


# Summary


Through additional analysis, I found:

•	There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation (72,458 retiring vs 1,549 eligible for mentorship)

•	72,458 positions will need to be filled soon. The number of retiring employees during the second analysis were less than the initial findings - 72,458 vs 90,398 employees. During the initial analysis of retiring employees by title, there were employees who were no longer working for the company that were not initially excluded, resulting in the variation of totals
